In this SQL coding, I did a final project thhroug Khan Acadamy on creating a store of clothing. I created 5 rows and had to create a table by sorting each item by price.

CREATE TABLE clothing (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, quantity INTEGER, price INTEGER, aisle INTEGER);

INSERT INTO clothing VALUES (1, "shirts", 5, 15, 7);
INSERT INTO clothing VALUES (2, "pants", 3, 20, 10);
INSERT INTO clothing VALUES (3, "shoes", 6, 15, 4);
INSERT INTO clothing VALUES (4, "socks", 8, 10, 3);
INSERT INTO clothing VALUES (5, "jackets", 3, 25, 1);

SELECT * FROM clothing ORDER BY price
